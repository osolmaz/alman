Alman is a simplified dialect of German designed to reduce the complexity of the language while maintaining mutual intelligibility with Standard German. It systematically eliminates several complex grammatical features:

- **Gender System**: Uses a single article form for most contexts
- **Case Markings**: Removes most case-based inflections
- **Noun Declensions**: Simplifies noun endings across cases
- **Job Titles**: Eliminates gender-specific forms in occupational titles

While Alman reduces grammatical complexity, it preserves:

- Core vocabulary
- Basic word order
- Verb conjugations
- Essential syntactic structures

This makes Alman easier to learn while remaining fully comprehensible to Standard German speakers.

## Project Goals

1. Reduce learning barriers for German language acquisition
2. Maintain full mutual intelligibility with Standard German
3. Preserve the essential character of German syntax
4. Systematically simplify grammar without loss of expressiveness
