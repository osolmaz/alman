# Alman: A Simplified Dialect of the German Language

**Version**: 0.4.0  

**Last Updated**: 2025-02-02


## 1. Introduction

Provides background on Alman's purpose, summarizes its core changes from Standard German, and explains the overall goal of simplifying grammar for easier learning and mutual intelligibility.


## 2. Articles

Details the treatment of definite and indefinite articles. Explains that all non-genitive forms use "die" (and "ein" for indefinite), while genitive forms use "der" (or "von ein" for indefinites). Also covers exceptions for demonstrative "das" and the use of "von die" to indicate possession, as well as guidelines for uncontracting phrases.


### ยง1. Definite Article Simplification

The Alman dialect systematically replaces the six case-inflected definite article forms of Standard German through morphological regularization, employing invariant forms for non-genitive and genitive cases while eliminating case-specific noun endings. All surface realizations of definite articles in non-genitive contexts (regardless of grammatical gender, number, or case) are replaced by **die**. Genitive contexts exclusively employ **der**, accompanied by elimination of genitive noun inflections.


#### ยง1a. Invariant 'die' for Non-Genitive Cases

All nominative, accusative, and dative definite articles (der/die/das/den/dem) are replaced by the invariant form 'die', neutralizing gender and case distinctions.


**Examples:**

| Standard German | Alman |
|------------------|-------|
| der Mann (Nominative) | die Mann |
| den Mann (Accusative) | die Mann |
| dem Mann (Dative) | die Mann |
| die Frau (Nominative/Accusative) | die Frau |
| der Frau (Dative) | die Frau |
| das Kind (Nominative/Accusative) | die Kind |
| dem Kind (Dative) | die Kind |



#### ยง1b. Invariant 'der' for Genitive Case

All genitive definite articles (des/der) are replaced by 'der', accompanied by elimination of genitive noun inflections.


**Examples:**

| Standard German | Alman |
|------------------|-------|
| des Mannes (Genitive) | der Mann |
| der Frau (Genitive) | der Frau |
| des Kindes (Genitive) | der Kind |



## 3. Nouns

Describes the removal of grammatical gender and all case-based noun endings. Specifies that nouns maintain a single form for nominative, accusative, and dative cases, with a distinct form ("der") for genitive, and explains how plural forms are preserved without additional case-specific modifications.


## 4. Adjectives and Adverbs

Explains that adjectives preceding a noun always end in -e, eliminating the traditional variety of declensional endings. Clarifies that adjectives functioning as modifiers before nouns are uniformly inflected, while adverbs (or adjectives used non-attributively) remain unchanged.


## 5. Pronouns and Other Determiners

Outlines that personal pronouns retain their standard forms and case inflections but are interpreted according to natural gender. Also covers the consolidation of traditionally gendered determiners (e.g., derjenige, diese, jene) into a single unified form for non-genitive contexts.
