    "body": "This section outlines the grammatical features that remain identical between Standard German and Alman. While Alman introduces various simplifications in areas like gender and case marking, it deliberately preserves certain core aspects of German grammar to maintain mutual intelligibility and structural clarity. The retention of these features ensures that Alman remains recognizably German while selectively implementing reforms in other areas.",
