      "description": "In <sd />, occupational titles are frequently marked for gender (e.g., *der Lehrer* versus *die Lehrerin*). In <alman />, such distinctions are eliminated. All job or occupation titles are rendered without gender-specific modifications; the feminine suffix is omitted, and the masculine form is universally employed. Consequently, occupational titles are treated analogously to other nouns by employing the invariant definite article **die** and the indefinite article **ein**.\n\nThis rule ensures a uniform treatment of occupational titles, reflecting the broader commitment within <alman /> to reduce gender differentiation in lexical items.",
