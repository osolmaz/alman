  "body": "The <alman /> dialect systematically eliminates grammatical gender distinctions and case-based noun inflections through morphological regularization. Nouns maintain a single invariant form across nominative, accusative, and dative cases, with genitive constructions employing a distinct analytical marker. Plural forms preserve their standard nominative/accusative morphology across all syntactic contexts.",

      "description": "Alman preserves standard German plural morphology without systematic regularization, maintaining existing plural forms in all non-conflicting contexts.

      "description": "To resolve potential ambiguity in nouns with identical singular/plural forms, Alman permits optional plural marking through suffixation. When clarity requires explicit plurality indication, speakers may employ either:\n- The native German -n plural suffix\n- The international -s suffix\n\nThis disambiguation preserves simplified morphology while accommodating lexical items where number distinction proves pragmatically essential. Suffix choice follows speaker preference and lexical convention.",
