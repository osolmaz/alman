  "body": "This section details <alman />'s elimination of grammatical gender and case inflections in nouns. All nouns adopt a single invariant form across nominative, accusative, and dative cases, with genitive contexts marked by **der** instead of case endings. Plural forms retain their standard nominative/accusative morphology in all cases, while optional suffixes (-n/-s) resolve ambiguity for nouns with identical singular/plural forms. Weak noun declensions and archaic dative endings are abolished.",
