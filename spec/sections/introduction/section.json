  "body": "The noun gender system of the German language, colloquially referred to as “der/die/das,” is notoriously difficult for those who learn German as an additional language (L2). We advocate that correct usage of noun genders is not crucial for most L2 learners in order to function in the German society. To this end, we construct a dialect, called <alman />, that unifies the masculine, feminine, and neuter genders into a single category and eliminates gender- and case-specific inflections. The resulting gender loss is akin to that experienced by English during the Middle English period. We present a formal description of <alman /> grammar.\n\nThe idea of <alman /> came out of the recognition that language complexity—especially in morphological systems like noun gender—can slow down language learning and hinder a foreigner's integration into the society. We claim that higher grammatical complexity comes with real-world costs, including delayed workforce integration and diminished productivity for migrants. By removing the necessity to memorize or deploy multiple gender markers, <alman /> seeks to mitigate these challenges without compromising the fundamental structure of German syntax and vocabulary.\n\nBeyond its practical benefits for newcomers, <alman /> remains mutually intelligible with <sd />. The dialect is designed to preserve essential word order (verb-second in main clauses and verb-final in subordinate clauses), retain well-known verb conjugations, and maintain overall lexical clarity. Rather than overhauling the entire grammar, it strategically reduces complexity where it matters most—namely in article usage, noun inflection, and adjective endings—allowing L2 learners to communicate more confidently at an earlier stage.\n\nThis specification provides a formal account of <alman /> grammar, detailing the rules for article simplification, noun morphology, adjectival endings, and other core linguistic elements. By illustrating these changes with numerous examples, we aim to offer both instructors and learners a clear roadmap for adopting this dialect. The goal is not to replace <sd /> but to introduce an accessible version that addresses pain points for adult learners, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and efficient language learning.",
